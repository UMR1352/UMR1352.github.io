Hey, I'm Enrico! I'm a software developer working remotely from the italian alps.
Welcome to my spot on the web for my projects, blog posts and anything else I feel
like sharing to the world.

Check out the projects page to see a highlight of what I'm working on in my free time,
and the blog for other random stuff I post.


You can contact me by email at **me@emarconi.xyz**, or on
[linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/enrico-marconi) if you fancy that..


## What I'm doing right now
Right now I'm working as a full-stack software engineer for [skillbill s.r.l](https://skillbill.it),
where I'm developing a very interesting project with Rust 🦀, RabbitMQ, Solid.js and Tailwind.

## Things that I like
* The Rust programming language 🦀
* Climbing, Mountaineering 🏔️
* Gardening, Foraging, Beekeeping 🍄

## Random facts
* I recently moved to a very small village in the italian alps ⛰️ and I'm loving it!
* I have a small garden 🌱 and a portion of wood 🌲
* I haven't cut any of my limbs off with my chainsaw (in your face, mum!)

## What people say about me
* > "You are a software engineer not a lumberjack!" <br />
